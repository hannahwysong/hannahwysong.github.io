          <h3>Project Details</h3>

          <p>
            This project consists of designing and building a website that functions as a class registration portal for a user to use to 
            register for classes with a major, minor, or combinaition of the two. This will consits of a website front end that will be used as an interface
            for the users to interact with and a MySql database as a backend to hold all of the class, major, and minor information.
